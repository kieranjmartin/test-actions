# R use

This repository will be using quarto. To support this, there is an renv lock file which is currently bare bones. 

# Deliverables

1. Principles for using Git and example workflow(s) in context of the current QC process
2. PHUSE Whitepaper on Git for Stat Programming, to cover:
- The case for Git
- Challenges using Git
- Current QC process
- Using Git for audit trails
- How Git can work with the current QC process
- How Git is typically used outside of stat programming and why
- How the QC process could look like using the benefits of a typical Git framework
- The point of view of regulators
3. Core education on Git for stat programmers.
4. Soft proposal for alternative QC process using Git features.
